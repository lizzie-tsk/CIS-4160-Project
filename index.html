      <h1>Hello Everyone ðŸ˜¼</h1>
      <h3>My name is Lizzie Tskhovrebadze! </h3>
      <p>
        <br>I am a senior majoring in Computer Science, trying to figure out how I see myself in the future. <br><br>

        I'm originally from Georgia (the country, not the state) and a fun fact about me is that during high school graduation,
        they announced my name about 5 times, and each time, my last name was pronounced in a completely different way. <br><br>

        Currently, I have two cats, but I tend to say that I only have one cat because 
        my second cat is a monster who likes to bite my ankles and eat anything on sight, including my freshly bought Shake Shack burger. 
        He ate through the paper it was wrapped in, and ripped through the plastic bag. Thankfully I decided not to get red peppers in my burger that night, 
        or he would have eaten my $12 burger, and would also cost me a $500 vet bill. <br><br>

        I actually came to Baruch as a Finance major and that changed after seeing the difference between how finance uses data compared to how I see myself using it.
        I have always loved numbers and understanding people, so I want to go into research and understanding how people think. I want to understand what motivates individuals
        to make their decisions and how it changes from person to person.
